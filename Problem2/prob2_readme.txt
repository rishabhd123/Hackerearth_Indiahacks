Objective: To predict the segment of a Hotstar customer, given his demographic info & video viewing patterns.

Model: just a single LightGBM

Score: ~0.8235 auc on CV, ~0.8212 on public LB. (Among Top 5 for this problem I think)

There's still scope to improve the score with feature engineering. But given my lead from Prob1, 
I was quite certain of qualifying & didn't invest more time into it.
