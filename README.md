There were 2 problems to solve in this online hackathon. 

Refer to the subfolders for each problem's description & code.

I did pretty well on both of them. Based on the cumulative score of both problems, I was ranked 1st on the Public LB. 

I'm unsure if the final rank will be based on cumulative scores or average rank, but I should be close to the top nonetheless.
